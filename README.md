Once that's done, you can use the `githubrepo` keyword to jump to a Github Repo!

# Caching

If you've got a lot of repos on Github, it can take awhile for the plugin to retrieve them all. To help with that, the plugin will cache results for an hour by default.

You can change the cache timeout or clear the cache from the settings menu.
